# GDOpenList 2
A new take on the [GDOL](https://github.com/ElectroFlameOfficial/GDOpenList/), originating from the [Penis List website](https://penis.kontroll.dev/).

This project will continue to be updated for the forseeable future, and almost all pull requests will be merged when noticed.

# How do I...

## Use this stack for my own list?
First, you'll want a hosting provider. I recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

A `vercel.json` file is included in the repository for easy setup.

Next, edit the `settings.json` to customise your list. Make sure you have an external list file that follows the same format as `example-list.json`

Finally, you'll want to follow the hoster's personal guide for uploading your list. (Usually, they require you to upload your list to a Git provider.)
